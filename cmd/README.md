# Management Console for WSO2 Micro Integrator

Command Line tool for managing the WSO2 Micro Integrator

## Getting Started

### Building from source 

- ### Setting up the development environment
    1. Install [Go 1.12.x](https://golang.org/dl)
    2. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/wso2/micro-integrator)
    3. Clone your fork into any directory
    5. `cd` into cloned directory and then cd into `micro-integrator/cmd`
    6. Execute `go mod vendor` or `go mod download` to download all the dependencies
    
- ### Building from source
    cd into micro-integrator home directory

    Execute `make install` to build both the **Micro Integrator** and **MIcro Integrator CLI** at once.

    Created Command Line tool packages will be available at cmd/build directory

- ### Running
    Extract the compressed archive generated to a desired location.
    
    Then execute `./mi` to start the application.
    
    Execute `./mi --help` for further instructions.

    NOTE: To execute the tool from anywhere, append the location of the executable (mi) to your $PATH variable.

- ### Command Autocompletion (For Bash Only)
    Copy the file `mi_bash_completion.sh` to `/etc/bash_completion.d/` and source it with `source /etc/bash_completion.d/mi_bash_completion.sh` to enable bash auto-completion.

### Configuration 

- ### How to Enable the Management API
    By default the Management Api is disabled. To use the Management Api you must use the system property `-DenableManagementApi` when starting the micro integrator

- ### Management API Address and Port
    To configure the address and the port of the Management Api in the CLI use the [**remote**](#remote) command. If no configuration is done, the address and the port will have the default values

    NOTE: The default hostname is localhost and the port is 9164.
